Greetings, Earthlings!

I'm Megan, and I am a graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles working on my PhD. My thesis will focus on using machine learning to improve the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).

**I'm passionate about building connectionsâ€”between nodes in networks, between us and potential extraterrestrial life, and between you and the wonders of science.**
