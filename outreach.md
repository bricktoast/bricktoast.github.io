As a marginalized identity in STEM, I am deeply committed to outreach and mentorship. I recognize the importance of fostering an inclusive, welcoming environment for all students, especially those who may not have had access to the same opportunities.

I was incredibly fortunate to have a family who understood and supported my journey in academia, yet I know this support is not available to everyone. Because of this, I am driven to plant seeds for future generations, helping to create pathways for students who may not have had the advantages I did.

# Current Outreach Projects

## Are we alone in the universe?

I cannot begin to express the excitement I felt when I was looking for a graduate program in SETI and found out that Jean-Luc Margot had a position at UCLA that combined SETI with outreach. Thanks to his efforts, my PhD thesis will be intertwined with a volunteer science project known as ["Are we alone in the universe?".](arewealone.earth)

As we speak, users of Are we alone? are creating the training data for the machine learning algorithm I am developing to reduce the effects of human-generated signals in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.

## Exploring Your Universe

[Exploring Your Universe](exploringyouruniverse.ucla.edu) is UCLA's largest science fair. For the past three years, I have helped run the event, most recently as the coordinator of our 74 science fair booths. It is estimated that over 10,000 people attend the event each year.

I truly believe that EYU represents the best kind of outreach. We bring science up close and personal to kids from all over LA, especially those from low-income areas. EYU funds transportation to bring these children to campus, provides meals for the day, and supplies our booths so that every child can take a bit of science home with them. We also give them all a tour of UCLA and encourage them to pursue higher education, if that's what they'd like to do.

EYU is run by grad students committed to giving every child a fair chance at exploring science. We’ve all been that child, curious and hopeful, and we’re incredibly fortunate to now do what we’re passionate about.

## Earth, Planetary, and Space Science Family Mentorship Program (EFMP)

EFMP was founded by my friend and classmate, [Dr. Valeria Jaramillo](https://scope.asu.edu/valeria-jaramillo/). EFMP matches UCLA Earth, Planetary, and Space Science graduate students with undergraduate students in "Families" that typically have a senior grad student (4th or 5th year), a junior grad student (1st-3rd year), an undergraduate Freshman/Sophomore, and an undergraduate Junior/Senior. The families are often matched by research interests, so that the more junior students can get a glimpse into future career paths and the more senior students can gain meaningful mentorship experience. I will become the EFMP coordinator in the Winter of 2025.

## The Order of the Octopus

The Order of the Octopus is a community for early-career researchers in SETI. It was founded by one of my research mentors, [Dr. Sofia Sheikh](https://www.seti.org/our-scientists/sofia-sheikh). In August of 2024, I served on the Science Organizing Committee for the Order's first in-person conference.


# Past Outreach Projects

## Big Sister STEM

Big Sister STEM is a nonprofit organization that I founded in 2020 to provide free virtual STEM mentorship to girls in middle school and high school. During the peak of quarantine, I found it important to offer support these girls as they navigated the transition to online learning. I ran Big Sister STEM until 2023, when I handed it off to Gillian McMahon, who was a wonderful successor. During my time as President, we fostered over 30 successful mentorships.


## Society of Physics Students at UCSD

At UCSD, I served as the Outreach Coordinator for the Society of Physics Students. I started SPS's traditions of General Atomics Lab Tours, Professional Development workshops, and Student Lighting Talks - a series where we give undergraduate students the opportunity to present their research to the group. I also co-founded the task force known as ARMS (Advocating and Represening Minority Students), which hosted workshops for students and faculty alike to discuss the experiences of marginalized identities in STEM. For my work with SPS, our chapter was awarded the 2021-2022 Outstanding Chapter Award.

## UCSD Astronomy Club

While at UCSD, I served as the President of the Astronomy Club. I hosted stargazing nights and invited speakers to give talks. This is a photo of my friend Roy and me using a solar telescope on a busy walkway on campus to attact new members.
