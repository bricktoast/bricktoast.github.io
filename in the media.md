My dream is to become a science communicator, sharing my passion for science and SETI with the world. Here are some of my favorite moments when Iâ€™ve had the chance to bring that dream to life!

In 2023, [Ben Paul,](https://physicalsciences.ucla.edu/person/benjamin-paul/) the Director of Communications for the UCLA Division of Physical Sciences, helped me write an autobiographical piece on my story as a third-generation UCLA student. The article is available in [English](https://physicalsciences.ucla.edu/three-generations-of-bruins/) and [Mandarin](https://physicalsciences.ucla.edu/%e5%9c%a8%e8%87%aa%e5%b7%b1%e7%9a%84%e6%a0%b9%e4%b8%8a%e8%8c%81%e5%a3%ae%e6%88%90%e9%95%bf/).

I did a quick little interview with the [Cosmic Leap Foundation](https://www.cosmic-leap.org/) where I spoke about my journey overcoming sterotypes and becoming a SETI researcher.

I was a finalist in UCLA's Grad Slam 2024, a speaking competition for graduate students in which you have exactly 3 minutes to explain your dissertation. Though I did not win, this is one of the best talks I have ever given, and I am so grateful I got to have this experience.
