 I would like to invite all of you to attend my dissertation defense. At the defense, I will present for an hour on ET and AI. Afterward, you will have the opportunity to ask me any and all questions you can think of. The defense will be in person at UCLA and on Zoom! Ideally, it will end with a party.

Please leave your email address below so I can let you know when the time has come. 

PS- A few of my friends and family have committed to dressing up as different eras of my life. Let me know if you need some ideas.
