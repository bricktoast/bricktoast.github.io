# *So, what makes someone decide to look for ET?*

I was born with life-threatening allergies so severe that several doctors have called me the worst case they’ve encountered. From birth, I was allergic to peanuts, tree nuts, dairy, eggs, wheat, soy, fish, shellfish, and countless other substances—some I can’t even remember now. Physical contact with these allergens often led to severe anaphylactic reactions, which, in infancy, were not only frightening but life-threatening.

In the early 2000s, food allergies were rarely taken seriously. They were often the butt of jokes on TV shows, dismissed by adults, or trivialized as quirks of “weird, nerdy kids.” Many people around me simply did not believe I was truly allergic. As a result, I spent the first five years of my life essentially quarantined. Being out of my parents’ sight was not an option; a simple touch from another child who had eaten a PB&J could have been fatal.

One safe place I had was my grandparents’ home next door. My grandmother, Jenny Lee, noticed my insatiable curiosity. She would carry me around the house, allowing me to explore the artifacts from her world travels. After I had touched each one, my grandfather, [Dr. Tom Lee,](https://taiwaneseamericanhistory.org/blog/101-dr-tom-lee/) would sit with me and read books on math, physics, and astronomy. My grandparents witnessed [their American dream](https://taiwaneseamericanhistory.org/blog/mystories269/) through my wonder at the universe, knowing their hard work had given me the freedom to pursue a life of passion over necessity. Those evenings together were instrumental in [my journey to becoming an astrophysicist.](https://physicalsciences.ucla.edu/three-generations-of-bruins/)

By second grade, I was stable enough to attend public school. Armed with two EpiPens, a box of crayons, and a mind filled with astronomy facts, I felt ready for the world. But being the “disabled new kid” who only wanted to talk about stars wasn’t an easy way to make friends. My peers often ostracized me, and my second-grade teacher refused to intervene when classmates tried to feed me allergens. My parents ultimately had to escalate the issue to the principal when my teacher continued to ignore my needs.

These experiences taught me early on that I deserved to be treated with dignity and respect, and that advocating for myself—even if uncomfortable—was non-negotiable. Standing up to adults, people meant to protect me, became a part of my identity. My disability forced me to be “loudly different,” even when I longed for quiet acceptance.

Years later, as a woman in STEM, I found similar challenges. Once again, I had to embrace being “loudly different,” even when it was difficult. But I am no longer that fearful child learning to speak up. I am still the curious girl who asked her grandmother about the world and her grandfather about the stars, but now I am driven by a deeper purpose.

Today, as a marginalized identity in STEM, I am acutely aware of the need for scientific [outreach.](megangrace.li/outreach) To me, SETI—the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence—is a form of outreach within astronomy. It represents our willingness to embrace the unknown, hoping we will encounter beings who are “loudly different” and letting them know they are not alone.

# FAQ

**Why do you go by so many names?** 

Names in academia carry a lot of weight. When I publish my name on a paper or presentation, I want you to know that nothing I achieve is done alone. In our patriarchal society, my dad’s influence is naturally acknowledged through my last name, Li. But both of my parents played equal roles in my education and upbringing. That’s why it’s important to me that my name reflects all of us—myself, Megan, then my mom, Grace, and then my dad.

On a more practical note, there are many Megan Li's in the world, and I want to make sure you can find me.

**What are you still allergic to now?**

Today, I am still highly allergic to peanuts, tree nuts, and insect stings. I also have a few other allergies that are not immediately life-threatening, but still annoying. These include latex, roses, anything with a fragrance, lavender, doxycyline, formaldehyde, nickel, cobalt, bronopol (which is in makeup), tattoo ink (including henna), p-phenylenediamine (which we use in hair dye), the entirety of the Bay Area for reasons I still do not understand, and a few others which I can't remember offhand.

**Have you found aliens yet?**
